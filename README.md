# The Post Party Playground

A full-stack e-commerce website catered to individuals who prefer the comfort of their own homes then going out, offering a vast selection of board games to choose from.

## Why I Built This

I built this project as a web developer who loves board games, aiming to showcase my programming skills while pursuing my personal interests. The goal was to create a platform that merges web development with the exciting world of board games. By bringing these two passions together, I wanted to demonstrate my expertise and provide an enjoyable experience for fellow board game enthusiasts.
